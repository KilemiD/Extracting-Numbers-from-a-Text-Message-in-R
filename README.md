# Extracting-Numbers-from-a-Text-Message-in-R
This project was inspired by Whatsapp text messages that contain numbers inside them. Oh, what a joy to work with unstructed data.
The code contained in this repo is a step by step guide on how to extract a set of digits from a text message in R. It starts with reading a dataset of whatsapp messages, containing a mixture of text and numbers and extracting the numbers to form a separate data set that can later be used for analysis.
